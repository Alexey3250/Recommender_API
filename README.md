# Recommender API

This repository contains the code for a recommendation system API. The system is designed to provide personalized recommendations based on user data.

## Repository Structure

The repository consists of the following main files:

1. `features_uploader.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook is used for gathering and transforming data, which is then uploaded to an SQL server for model training. It includes methods for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).

2. `training.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for training the recommendation model. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation steps. Various machine learning algorithms and techniques are used in this process.

3. `service.py`: This is the main service file for the API. It handles API requests and responses, and uses the trained model to generate recommendations. It includes methods for handling HTTP requests, processing data, and returning responses.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

2. Install the required Python libraries.
3. Run the `features_uploader.ipynb` notebook to gather and transform data.
4. Run the `training.ipynb` notebook to train the model.
5. Run `service.py` to start the API service.

### API Usage
